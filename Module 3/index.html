 <h2>Chicken</h2>
 He heard quiet steps behind him. That didn't bode well.
Who could be following him this late at night and in this deadbeat
part of town? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off
the big time and was making off with the greenbacks. Was there another
crook who'd had the same idea, and was now watching him and waiting
for a chance to grab the fruit of his labour? Or did the steps behind
him mean that one of many law officers in town was on to him and just
waiting to pounce and snap those cuffs on his wrists? He nervously
looked all around. Suddenly he saw the alley. Like lightning he darted
off to the left and disappeared between the two warehouses almost
falling over the bin lying in the middle of the pavement. He tried to
nervously tap his way along in the inky darkness and suddenly
stiffened: it was a dead-end, he would have to go back the way he had
come. The steps got louder and louder, he saw the black outline of a
figure coming around the corner. Is this the end of the line? he
thought pressing himself back against the wall trying to make himself
invisible in the dark, was all that planning and energy wasted? He was
dripping with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the fear coming
off his clothes. Suddenly next to him, with a barely noticeable
squeak, a door swung quietly to and fro in the night's breeze. Could
this be the haven he'd prayed for? Slowly he slid toward the door,
pressing himself more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from
his enemy. Would this door save his hide?He heard quiet steps behind
